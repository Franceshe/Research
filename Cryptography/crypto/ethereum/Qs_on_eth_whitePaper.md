# Ethereum:


## Some several interesting facts about Crypto in general:
### Past efforts before bitcoin:
... New way of creating money:
Wei Dai's b-money became the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money 
through "solving computational puzzles as well as decentralized consensus"
* Why some projects failed for reliance on trusted backend?
... In 2005, Hal Finney introduced a concept of reusable proofs of work
, but once again fell short of the ideal by relying on "trusted computing as a backend".
* Why "proof of work(computaional power)" is not equivalent to "proof of stake(currency holding)";

### Some basic glossary:
* proof of stake:
... calculating the weight of a node as being proportional to its currency holdings and not computational resources.
* proof of work: Which bitcoin shines.The weight of a single node in the consensus voting process is directly proportional to the computing power that the node brings.
