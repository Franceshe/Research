## Course Overview:
* Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. 
* This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. 
Participants will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply 
this knowledge to real-world applications.
* The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate
securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols
and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that 
let two parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key
encryption and basic key exchange. Throughout the course participants will be exposed to many exciting open 
problems in the field and work on fun (optional) programming projects.  
* In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as 
  * zero-knowledge 
  * privacy mechanisms
  * and other forms of encryption.
