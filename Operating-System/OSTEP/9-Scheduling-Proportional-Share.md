# 9:Scheduling: Proportional Share

* sidenote1: the proprotional-share scheduler which emphasized the proble of fairness and used ticket mechanism for ownership distribution is interesting. Same mechanism of tickets, currency, use of randomness for speed up of system decision, ticket inflation in trusted environment have similar low level abstract architecture of the circulation of economic system. Cryoto community is working hard toward it. Community related operation can also learn from it.
* sidenote2: How the system solve ticket assignment issue? I think it could learn from the concept of MLFQ with history + algorithm to predict the amount of ownerhip of future while monitor the execution of current behavior.
* sidenote3: also the proportional sharing mechanism could be applied to shread memory-> virtualization of memory algorithmically -> software 2.0
