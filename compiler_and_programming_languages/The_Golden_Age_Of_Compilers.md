# SPLOS Keynote: The Golden Age of Compiler Design in an Era of HW/SW Co-design by Dr. Chris Lattner

## Hardware getting hard
* The world gets heterogeneous as the application, eg: reinforcement learning, integrate postcompute
and accelerate compute.
* Need better hardware abstraction, allow software to innovate without too specialized for hardware

## MLIR: Compiler Infra at the end of Moore's Law
* Named as: Multi-Level Intermediate Representation
* Allows you to build acceleartor compiler more quickly
