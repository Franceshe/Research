## What is numenta:
* Numenta is a machine intelligence company that has developed a cohesive theory, core software, technology and applications based on the principles of the neocortex. Founded by Jeff Hawkins.

## Core technology:
* Numenta's machine intelligence technology is called hierarchical temporal memory (HTM), and is a computational theory of the neocortex.[3] This theory was first described in the book On Intelligence, written in 2004 by Jeff Hawkins and co-author Sandra Blakeslee. At the core of HTM are time-based learning algorithms that store and recall temporal patterns. The HTM algorithms are documented and available through its open source project, NuPIC. The HTM technology is suited to address a number of problems, particularly those with the following characteristics: streaming data, underlying patterns in data change over time, subtle patterns, time-based patterns.
