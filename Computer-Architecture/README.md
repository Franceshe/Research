# Inspiration
* [A New Golden Age for Computer Architecture with Dave Patterson](https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/computerarchitecture)


## Resource
* [Coursera: Advanced Computer Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch)

## Aspiration
* While trying to deploy machine learning models at scale, I found more knowledge about exploit advantanges of vector processors and understanding of different types of parallelism, like instructional parallelism, data parallelism and thread parallelism are pretty useful. Process level and vector level parallelism may be out of scope for now.

### Textbook
* [Computer Architecture, A Quantitative Approach, Patterson and Hennessy, 5th edition].
* [Modern Processor Design Fundamentals of Super-Scalar Processors]
